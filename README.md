## LangChain - Chat with Search

This Streamlit application integrates with **LangChain** to provide a chatbot that can perform live web searches, fetch academic papers from Arxiv, and retrieve information from Wikipedia. The app allows users to interact with the chatbot and receive relevant information based on real-time queries.

### Features:
- **Arxiv API**: Retrieves the top academic paper related to the user's query.
- **Wikipedia API**: Provides a concise summary from Wikipedia based on the query.
- **DuckDuckGo Search**: Performs web searches for information using DuckDuckGo.
- **ChatGroq Integration**: Utilizes the Llama3-8b-8192 model for natural language processing.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Uses `StreamlitCallbackHandler` to display the chatbot's thoughts and actions live in the app.

### How it Works:
1. Users input a query or topic through the chat interface.
2. The chatbot searches various sources (Arxiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo) to fetch relevant information.
3. The chatbot responds interactively, displaying results directly in the Streamlit app.

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. Add your Groq API key in the app sidebar to enable the chatbot's functionality.
3. Run the app locally with `streamlit run <app.py>`.
